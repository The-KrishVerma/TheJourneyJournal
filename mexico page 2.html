                <h3>Metro Systems in Major Cities</h3>
                <div class="highlight-text">

                    <p>
                        Mexico City boasts one of the most efficient metro systems in Latin America, with 12 lines
                        connecting most parts of the city. The metro is both affordable and fast, costing just 5 MXN
                        ($0.30 USD) per ride. It is also well-maintained and frequently updated, making it a reliable
                        choice for daily commuters and tourists. Additionally, the metro system operates from early
                        morning until late at night, providing flexibility for various schedules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Guadalajara and Monterrey also offer modern metro services, ideal for navigating their urban
                        centers. Note that peak hours can get crowded, so plan your travel accordingly. Both cities have
                        multiple lines connecting key areas, and the metro is an efficient and cost-effective way to
                        move around, especially during busy periods. Like Mexico City, the metro in these cities offers
                        affordability, making it a popular option for both locals and visitors.

                <h3>Intercity Buses</h3>

                    <p>
                        Mexico’s intercity bus system is renowned for its comfort and reliability. Companies like ADO,
                        ETN, and Primera Plus offer various classes of service, from economy to luxury, with onboard
                        amenities like Wi-Fi and reclining seats. The buses are well-maintained, providing a smooth and
                        comfortable ride, making long-distance travel convenient and enjoyable.

                    <p>
                        Booking tickets online or at bus terminals is straightforward, with many companies offering
                        mobile apps for easy access to schedules and reservations. Buses are a great way to travel long
                        distances while enjoying scenic routes, often passing through picturesque landscapes, mountains,
                        and coastal areas. Many bus stations also offer amenities like lounges, restaurants, and
                        restrooms.

            <div class="highlight-section">
                <h3>Colectivos (Shared Vans)</h3>
                <div class="highlight-text">

                    <p>
                        Colectivos are shared vans that operate on fixed routes, commonly used in smaller towns and
                        tourist areas like Cancun and Playa del Carmen. They are an affordable and efficient way to
                        travel short distances, especially to areas not serviced by larger buses or taxis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Simply flag down a colectivo along its route and pay a small fee when you get off. The vans are
                        typically air-conditioned, offering a comfortable ride even during hot weather. Colectivos
                        provide a great way to meet locals and experience authentic travel in Mexico. Some colectivos
                        also offer flexible pick-up and drop-off points, providing more convenience for travelers. While
                        they tend to be faster than buses, it’s best to plan ahead during peak tourist seasons, as they
                        can get crowded.
                    </p>

            <div class="highlight-section">
                <h3>Taxis and Ride-Sharing Services</h3>
                <img src="./mexico2/Nissan_Tsuru_taxi_Mexico_Ciudad.jpg" alt="Taxi in Mexico" class="highlight-image">
                <div class="highlight-text">

                    <p>
                        Taxis are widely available, but it’s important to use authorized taxi services or apps to ensure
                        safety and fair pricing. In larger cities, ride-sharing apps like Uber, Didi, and Cabify are
                        reliable and convenient. These apps allow you to track your ride in real-time and pay digitally,
                        providing an added layer of security and transparency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Always confirm the fare before starting your journey if you’re using a traditional taxi, as they
                        may not use meters. If the taxi doesn’t have a meter, agree on a fixed price before getting in
                        to avoid potential overcharging. Additionally, many cities now have designated taxi stands at
                        major points like airports and train stations to ensure safety and reliability. It’s also
                        advisable to have small change on hand, as some drivers may not carry enough to give change for
                        larger bills.

            <div class="highlight-section">
                <h3>Domestic Flights</h3>
                <div class="highlight-text">

                    <p>
                        For long distances, domestic flights are a time-saving option. Airlines like Aeromexico,
                        Volaris, and VivaAerobus offer competitive rates and frequent connections between major cities
                        and tourist destinations. These flights are often the quickest way to travel between regions,
                        especially for hard-to-reach destinations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Booking in advance can help you secure the best deals. Keep in mind that budget airlines may
                        charge extra for luggage, and additional fees may apply for seat selection or other services.
                        It’s always a good idea to check the airline’s baggage policy before booking to avoid surprises
                        at the airport.
