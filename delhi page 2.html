            <div class="highlight-section">
                <h3>Auto and Cycle Rickshaws</h3>
                <div class="highlight-text">

                    <p>
                        Auto rickshaws are also equipped with meters, but they are not always used, so agreeing on a
                        fare beforehand can save you from disputes. Additionally, ride-hailing apps like Uber and Ola
                        also offer auto rickshaw options, ensuring a hassle-free and fair pricing system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a more traditional experience, cycle rickshaws are also available, especially in the older
                        areas of Delhi like Chandni Chowk and Hauz Khas. These rickshaws offer a slower, more
                        picturesque way to explore the narrow streets and back alleys of the city, providing visitors
                        with a close-up view of local life. They are also an eco-friendly option for exploring short
                        distances.

                <div class="highlight-text">
                    <p>
                        Taxis are available throughout Delhi, but it’s advisable to opt for pre-paid taxis or those
                        hired via trusted apps such as Ola and Uber for both convenience and safety. Traditional taxis
                        often charge higher fares, especially if they are not metered. Always ensure the driver starts
                        the meter if using a traditional taxi to avoid overpaying.
                    </p>

                        cars and competitive pricing. These services are especially helpful for getting around the

                        also a growing option in some areas for quick travel. For group travel, ride-sharing apps also
                        provide options like SUVs or premium cars, which can be pre-booked for added convenience.

                        convenience. Additionally, several hotels provide private airport transfers for a more
                        personalized travel experience. Passengers can also access 24/7 car rental services for flexible

            <h2 class="section-title">Tips from Locals:</h2>
            <div class="highlight-text">
                <p>
                    Always carry an umbrella or a hat as the weather in Delhi can be extreme, especially during summers.
                    Keeping a bottle of water handy is highly recommended as you’ll often encounter high temperatures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For bus and metro travel, it’s useful to have a metro card or a DTC bus pass to avoid waiting in
                    long lines for tickets. You can recharge the metro card online or at the station.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Delhi traffic can be overwhelming, especially during rush hours. Avoid travelling during peak hours
                    if possible. For a quicker trip, metro services are more time-efficient as they bypass traffic
                    completely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you plan to rent a car, be cautious of the traffic conditions in Delhi, which are known for being
                    chaotic. Always drive defensively and be prepared for sudden changes in traffic behavior.
