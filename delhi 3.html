                        <strong>Thingvellir National Park:</strong> The location of Iceland’s first Parliament, and where the North American & Eurasian 
                        tectonic plates are slowly splitting apart from each other. You can spend a lot of time here, walking the trails. 
                        This is also where Silfra is, where you can go snorkeling or scuba diving between the plates.

                        <strong>Geysers at Haukadalur:</strong> An impressive geothermal area featuring two natural geysers that erupt on 
                        a regular basis. Churning boiling water that smells like eggs. You don’t have to wait long to see them go off either!

                        <strong>Gullfoss Waterfall:</strong> This wide & fast-moving river turns a corner and falls 100 feet into a huge 
                        waterfall, producing thick mist & frequent rainbows. From here most people turn around and head back to the Ring Road, or to Reykjavik.
